## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete the form and see a success toast message upon successful submission
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A required field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- Have inputs, error messages, and the success message announced on their screen reader
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

This was my first experience. So I used HTML, CSS and Javascript to be able to build contact form.


### What I learned

I learned how to use Javascript to improve the working principle of the website. I used it to be able to give errors when any of the inputs is empty, send success message when all the inputs are filled.


### Continued development

I need to learn more concepts in Front-End Web development. I would like to learn more about Javascript. I will try to test out HTML5 for next times to understand its working principle as well.
